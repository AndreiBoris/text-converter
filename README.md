# Text Converter

[Use it.](http://andreicommunication.github.io/text-converter/)

This is your run of the mill text converter. Enter some text in the top textbox,
press the button, and have the text be converted according to the checkbox options
you set above. If someone thinks they have a worthwhile feature they want to add
let me know and I'll do that, it'd only take a few minutes. Better yet, add it
yourself and send a pull request, I'd love that.

### Features

* Escape apostrophes (`'` becomes `\'`)
* Escape newlines (`NEWLINE` becomes `\n`)
